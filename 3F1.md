## L1. Introduction and Recap
### 1.1 Euler Method for Solving ODE
* Given the gradient (rate of change) of some variable over time $\dfrac{dy}{dt}=f(y,t)$
* Define a fixed timestep $\delta t$. Then, ignoring initial conditions, we can derive an approximate solution for the next timestep:
  $$
  y(t+\delta t) = y(t)+\delta t \times \dfrac{dy}{dt} = y(t)+\delta t \times f(y, t)
  $$
### 1.2 Pros and Cons of Discrete Time Methods
* Examples using digital signal processors (Digital circuits) over the analogue/continuous (Analog electronics) processes are: digital audio, digital communication link, image processing and speech synthesis.
* Note Discrete Time is different from digital signals, **discrete time signals have quantized time interval but the output is not quantized, digital outputs are quantized**. Below are the advantages and disadvantages of discrete time methods:

  | Advantages  | Disadvantages|
  |:-------------:|:-------------:|
  |Algorithms can be implemented on any hardware | $\delta t$ determines the stability which is hard to guarantee|
  |Flexible and easy to modify| Need ADC/DAC hardware
  | Easy to implement complex control systems| Finite sampling rate

### 1.3 LTI Systems Revision
* A system is **linear** if it satisfies the Principal of Superposition:
  if $\mathcal{L}(u_1(t))=y_1(t) $ and $\mathcal{L}(u_2(t))=y_2(t)$, then for any scalars $\alpha_1, \alpha_2$:
  $$
  \mathcal{L}(\alpha_1 u_1 + \alpha_2 u_2) = \alpha_1 \mathcal{L}(u_1(t)) + \alpha_2\mathcal{L}(u_2(t)) = \alpha_1 y_1(t) + \alpha_2 y_2(t)
  $$
* A system is **time-invariant** if $\mathcal{L}(u(t))=y(t)$ then $\mathcal{L}(u(t+T))=y(t+t)$ for any time interval $T$
* Note nearly all real world systems are not time invariant, i.e. the structural integrity of a bridge changes over time.
* A system is *stable* if the transfer function $G(s)$ has no poles in the right half plane or on the imaginary axis.
* For a stable LIT system $G(s)$, the steady state response for an input $u(t) = \sin(\omega t)$ is:
$$
y_{ss}(t)=|G(j\omega)|\sin(\omega t+ \angle G(j\omega))
$$
* The Nyquist Stability Criterion gives a test for the closed loop system to be stable. Consider the following feedback system:
  * First plot the Nyquist diagram of $F(s)G(s)K(s)$, which is the locus of $F(j\omega)G(j\omega)K(j\omega)$ as $\omega$ varies from $-\infty$ through to 0 to $\infty$
  * Let $N$ be the number of anti-clockwise encirclements of the $-1/k$ point of the Nyquist diagram
  * Closed loop stability is achieved $\iff N = \textrm{\# of RHP poles of} \; F(s)G(s)K(s)$

* MATLAB Nyquist Implementation (Non library):
In order to plot the nyquist plot for $G(s) = \dfrac{1}{(s+2)(s+4)(s+6)}$:
```Matlab
% create symbolics and transfer functions
syms s w
G = 1/((s+2) * (s+4) * (s+6));

% substitute jw into the transfer function
G_w = subs(G, s, j*w);

% sweep across all frequencies
W = [-100 : 0.1 : 100];
Nyq = eval(subs(G_w, w, W));

% plot the real part against imaginary part
x = real(Nyq)
y = imag(Nyq)
```
* MATLAB Nyquist Implementation (Library)
```Matlab
% create transfer function
G = tf ([0 0 0 1],[1 12 44 48])
% plot with built in function
nyquist(G)
grid on
```
