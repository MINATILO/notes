## L1. Inventory Management
### 1.1 Background Definitions
* **Inventory**: a physical resource that a firm holds in stock with the intent of transforming it into a more valuable state
* **Inventory System**: a set of policies and controls that monitor levels of inventory and determine what levels should be maintained and replenished
* **Little's Law**: there is a minimum inventory needed to run the factory
* **Arguments against inventory**:
  * Cost of capital
  * Opportunity Cost
  * Deprecation of goods
  * Labour and handling
  * Warehousing, rent and energy
  * Insurance and overhead to admin labour, space,etc
* **Inventory Management Questions**:
  * **Order quality (Q)**, how much should we order?
  * **Reorder point(ROP;R)**, when should we replace an order?
  * **Safety stock (SS)**, how much safety stock should we maintain?

### 1.2 Economic Order Quality (EOQ)
EOQ aims to solve the problem of **batch sizing**, how much should we order each time? If we use large order size, then we suffer a large inventory *holding cost*, if we use small order size, then we summer a large *fixed cost of ordering* (in forms of transport, handling, labour,etc). **Where do we find a balance?**
Define the following variables:
* $D$ = demand per period
* $Q$ = batch size (quantity to order each time)
* $C_o$ = fixed cost of placing one order (ordering cost)
* $C_H$ = cost of holding one item in store for one period (rent,etc)

We aim to find an equation $T(Q)$ which describes the total cost as a function of order size $Q$, and minimize it. Intuitively, fixed cost decreases exponentially the more we order and holding cost increases linearly. The actual model used is:
$$
T(Q) = \dfrac{Q}{2}C_H + \dfrac{D}{Q} C_o
$$

</center>

In order to minimize $T(Q)$, we simply take the derivative of it, i.e. find the $Q^*$ where $T'(Q)=0$, its analytical solution is:
$$
Q^*=\sqrt{2D \dfrac{C_o}{C_H}}
$$
Intuitively, the more it costs to place an order, the less frequent we should make an order so the more quantity we should order each time; the more it costs to hold the order, the less quantity we should place each time.

Another quantity we should solve is the **reorder point $R$**, the point at which we should place an order (due to both safety stock and time lag for order to arrive) defined as
$$
R=dL+SS
$$
Where $d$ is the average demand per time period defined as $d=D/\textrm{\# working days}$, $L$ is the number of time periods between placing the order and delivery and $SS$ is the safety stock. **Hence, once our inventory reaches $R$, we should order quantity $Q^*$**.
There are **problems with EOQ**:
* Demand is assumed to be constant and steady which is not true
* EOQ assumes whole replenishment lot arrives at the same time
* Replenishment lead-time is known
* Order size is not constrained by the supplier
* Holding cost per item per period is a constant
* Cost of ordering/setup is constant
* Item is independent of others

There are also **benefits**:
* EOQ is robust; relatively insensitive to errors in estimating $D, C_H, C_O$
* Tends to inflate batch/order sizes
* Can be adapted to different situations and the type of inventory being used
* Empirically, EOQ models are <12% away from optimum

### 1.3 Newsvendor Model: Inventory Management Under Stochastic Demand
For a newsvendor, daily sales cannot be predicted exactly and are represented by the random variable, $D$. At the start of each day, a newsvendor must decide on the number of papers to purchase and sell as the paper's value becomes worthless the next day.
Note that now **$D$ is no longer a constant, it is a random variable characterised by a probability distribution!** We therefore need to know the cumulative distribution function (cdf) for demand and the overage/underage costs. We denote the total overage/underage cost as $G(Q,D)$ defined as:
$$
G(Q,D) = c_O \max (0, Q-D) + c_u \max(0, D-Q)
$$
At any given demand quantity (remember it is a distribution now), our inventory is either over the demand or below the demand, hence another way to think of this function is:
$$
G(Q,D)=
\begin{cases}
c_u(D-Q) \;\;\; \textrm{if} \;\;\; D\geq Q   \\
c_O(Q-D) \;\;\; \textrm{if} \;\;\; D\leq Q
\end{cases}
$$
Of course, $G(Q,D)$ is another probability distribution, we are interested in $G(Q) = \mathcal{E}[G(Q,D)]$ which is the expectation of overage+underage cost if $Q$ is ordered, to evaluate $G(Q)$ we need to integrate over all possibilities of $D$, denoted as $f(x)dx \quad \forall x\in D$:

$$
G(Q)=\mathcal{E}[G(Q,D)]=\int_0^\infty G(Q,x)f(x)dx
$$
since for any values where $x<Q, x\in D$ we are in the scenario where demand is less than quantity ordered, we are in overage (vice versa for $x>Q$), putting all these together with the definition for $G(Q,D)$ we have the formula below:
$$
\int_0^\infty G(Q,x)f(x)dx = \int_0^Q c_O (Q-x)f(x)dx + \int_Q^∞ c_u(x-Q)f(x)dx
$$
Now **given the distribution of $D$, constants $c_O, c_u$**, we can compute $G(Q)$ and solve for its first derivative to be zero (while checking to ensure it is indeed a minima through its second order derivative), we *may* (proof omitted) arrive at the condition below:
$$
\dfrac{dG(Q)}{dQ}=0\; |\;Q=Q* \quad \rightarrow \quad F(Q*)=\dfrac{c_u}{c_u+c_O}
$$
Where $F(Q*)$ is the cumulative distribution up to the point $Q^*$ which is the area underneath the demand probability density function right until the point of $D=Q^*$
Checking this result with our intuition, if the overage cost and the underage cost is the same, then we *should* order the exact same quantity as the average demand, this seems like a good compromise between ordering too much and ordering too little. Plugging $c_u=c_O$ into $F(Q^*)$, we have $F(Q^*)=0.5$, assuming the demand is normally distributed with some mean $μ$, we know that for
$$
P(D\leq z) = \Phi (z)=0.5, \;|\;\; D \sim \mathcal{N(μ,0)} \quad \rightarrow \quad z=μ
$$
Which proves our intuition that $Q^*$ must be equal to $\mu$, the expected quantity demanded if underage and overage costs are the same*.

### 1.3 (Q,R) Policy: Another Model Under Stochastic Demand
Recall in the EOQ model, we are interested in calculating two values $Q$, the ordering quantity and $R$, the point at which we should place a reorder. This order will then arrive after $L$ time periods (usually defined as the number of working days). Under stochastic model, $Q$ and $R$ can no longer be determined easily as the demand is no longer deterministic. This is illustrated in the graph below (with the gradient being negative of demand per unit time):

</center>

Note that both $Q$ and $R$ are decision variables and **cycle time is no longer constant!** Our objective therefor is to minimize the expected trade offs in $R$ and $Q$. There are several costs that contribute towards our total cost:
* Backorder costs: cost incurred by a business when it is unable to fill an order and must complete it later, i.e effects of poor customer service (R tradeoff)
* Holding costs (Both Q and R trade off)
* Fixed costs (Q trade off)

In order to describe the $(Q,R)$ model, we need to define a couple of constants:
* $λ$: **overall** expected demand per unit time
* $L$: lead time, the time that elapses from the time an order is placed until it arrives, assumed to be constant
* $K$: setup cost per order
* $h$: holding cost per unit per unit time
* $c$ purchase price per unit
* $p$ penalty cost per unit of unsatisfied demand
* $T$ cycle time defined as $\dfrac{Q}{λ}$
* $s$ the average inventory level before an order arrives (reorder level - expected demand during leadtime) defined as $R-\mu$ (see below for $\mu$)

We also assume that $D$ represents the **demand during the lead time** and has probability distribution $F(x)\sim \mathcal{N}(μ,σ)$. Figure below illustrates how due to the variation in quantity demanded, we may end up with either excess inventory (purple lines) or stockout (green lines).

Putting all these together, we model the total cost per unit time as the sum of hilding cost, fixed cost and shortage cost:

$$
C(Q)=h\left(s+\dfrac{Q}{2}\right) + \dfrac{K}{T} + p \dfrac{n(R)}{T}
$$

$n(R)$ is an important quantity, it is the expected shortage per cycle. Obviously, if $D>R$ we have a shortage $=D-R$, otherwise if $D<R$, we have no shortage. Hence the expected shortage is evaluated as:
$$
n(R)=\int_0^R 0f(x)dx + \int_R^\infty (x-R)f(x)dx = \int_R^\infty (x-R)f(x)dx = σL(z)
$$
Where $σL(z)$ is the standard loss function, i.e. the expected number of lost sales as a fraction as the standard deviation (this is just a function quiet frequently used in economics). The total cost equation $C(Q)$ is rewritten substituting the value of $T$ and $s$:
$$
C(Q) = h\left(\dfrac{Q}{2}+R-λL\right)+K\dfrac{λ}{Q} + p\dfrac{λn(R)}{Q}
$$
This total cost is minimized when:
$$
Q = \sqrt{\dfrac{2λ[K+pn(R)]}{h}}
$$
here, as reorder level $R$ increases, holding cost increases causing the expected shortage $n(R)$ to decrease therefore the order quantity decreases. Also
$$
F(R) = 1-\dfrac{Qh}{pλ} = \Phi(z)
$$
which intuitively as the quantity ordered increases, we need to decrease the holding cost, therefore we decrease the reorder level to bring the cost backdown. The formula for the reordering point is:
$$
R = \mu + \sigma z
$$
where $z=\phi^{-1}(F(R))$


## L2. Decision Analysis
Consider the following payoff table relating purchasing land at two different locations and the outcome of whether or not an airport is built on that land:
<center>

![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181022175132](/assets/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181022175132.png)
</center>

The payoff table forms a payoff matrix $r$ with elements $r_{ij}$, $i$ indexing the decisions (rows) and $j$ indexing the external outcome (columns).

### 2.1 Expected Monetary Value
The expected monetary value takes the formula below:
$$
\textrm{EMV}_i = \sum_j r_{ij}p_j
$$
It is simply the expected gain/loss for each decision, i.e. for $P(\textrm{Location}=A)=0.4$ we have:
<center>

![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181022175346](/assets/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181022175346.png)
</center>

### 2.2 Expected Opportunity Loss
The expected opportunity loss (EOL) has the formula:
$$
\textrm{EOL}_i=\sum_jg_{ij}p_j
$$
The matrix $g_{ij}$ is the opportunity loss matrix, which is the difference between maximum payoff and the current payoff within each element of the payoff matrix, the mathematical notation is:
$$
g_{ij} = \max_k r_{kj} - r_{ij}
$$
This is shown more clearly in the example table:
<center>

![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181022180556](/assets/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181022180556.png)
</center>

Here, $\max_k r_{kj \; |\; j=\textrm{Airport at A}}$ is 13M showns in the payoff table, therefore ** is calculated as: $-(-8-13) = 21\textrm{M}$
Also there exists the following relationship:

</center>

### 2.3 Perfect Information
From the last formula in the section above, alternative way to calculate EOL given EMV matrix is to first calculate the maximum expected gain (Perfect Information):
$$
\textrm{PI} = \sum_j (\max_k r_{kj})p_j
$$
In the example above PI is $13\times 0.4+11\times 0.6=11.8\textrm{M}$, then for each decision $i$, the EOL is $11.8-\textrm{EMV}_i$
What perfect information means is if someone could predict with 100% certainty where the airport is built, whether this person will say the airport is built in A or B is still beyond our control. If we hired this "God", then our expected payoff would be:
$$
0.4\times 13 + 0.6\times 11 = £11.8\textrm{M}
$$
Without this "God" our maximum EMP will be 3.4M from the previous section. Hence the **expected value of perfect information** (EVPI) is $11.8-3.4=£8.4\textrm{M}$, the mathematical definition of EVPI is:
$$
\textrm{EVPI} = \textrm{PI} - \max_i(\textrm{EMV}_i) = \min_i(\textrm{EOL}_i)
$$
### 2.4 Expected Value of Sampled Information

### 2.5 Utility Theory
Given two random tields $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, a decision maker prefers $Y_1$ to $Y_2$ if and only if the expected utility of $Y_1$ is larger than the expected utility of $Y_2$:
$$
Y_1 \succ Y_2 \iff \mathcal{E}[U(Y_1)] > \mathcal{E}[U(Y_2)]
$$
Where the utility function $U(x)$ defines the risk preference which maps the random yield $Y_1$ onto a "preference" yield, there are three types of utility functions:
* 1. **risk averse**:
  * Characterised by $\mathcal{E}[U(Y)]\leq U(\mathcal{E}[Y])$
  * This implies $U(x)$ is concave
* 2. **risk-seeking**:
  * Characterised by $\mathcal{E}[U(Y)]\geq U(\mathcal{E}[Y])$
  * Which implies that $U(x)$ is concave
* 3. **risk-neutral**:
  * Characterised by $\mathcal{E}[U(Y)] =  U(\mathcal{E}[Y])$
  * Therefore $U(x)$ is a linear function
