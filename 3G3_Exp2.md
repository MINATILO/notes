# 3G3 Exp 1 Neurons and Synapses
**1.Describe three different factors influencing synaptic efficacy, and for each provide one example of how they change during synaptic plasticity**
- Ca$^{2+}$ influx
  - Greater influx of potassium ion activates the NMDA channel through removing the magnesium ion, which allows more Calcium ions to flow in.
  - PKA phosphorylates a K$^{+}$ channel, causing it to close, which broadens the action potential and thus enhances Ca$^{2+}$ influx through voltage-gated Ca$^{2+}$ channels which in turn enhances transmitter release
- Number of vesicles released
  - Serotonin can bind with serotinin receptor coupled with a G protein which leads to the hydrolysis of phospholipids and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC)
  - PKC can act on vesicles causing more of them to be released
- Number of receptors on the postsynaptic synapse
  - Increased Ca$^{2+}$ ions cause increased amount of AMPA receptors, increased activity of AMPA receptors and the generation of retrosignals which provides positive feedback
  - Ca$^{2+}$ ions binds with calmodulin  forming complex which activates CAMKinase (CaMKII).
  - CamKinase phosphorylate AMPA receptors increasing their conductance to sodium ions
  - CamKinase also promotes AMPA receptors from intracellular stores into the membrane making new AMPA receptors
- Number of synapse
  - During long term sensitization or habituation, the number of synapses from the sensory neuron may increase or decrease accordingly.

**2. Name one ionotropic and one metabotropic receptor and describe one example system for each in
which they play an important role in synaptic transmission or plasticity**
- **Ionotropic: NMDA and AMPA**
  - Composed of four or five subunits that form a single macromolecule
  - Contain both an extracellular domain that forms the binding site for the transmitter and a membrane-spanning domain that forms an ion conducting pore
  - Upon binding neurotransmitter, the receptor **undergoes a conformational change that opens the channel**
  - Produce relatively fast synaptic actions lasting only milliseconds, commonly found at synapses in neural circuits that mediate rapid behaviors
  - **Ionotropic glutamate receptors** have been divided into four subtypes on the basis of their ligand binding properties and sequence similarity: **AMPA, kainate, NMDA and delta** receptors (AMPA, NMDA discussed later.)
  - **NMDA AMPA receptors** are responsible for classical conditioning in the postsynaptic neuron:
    - Glutamate is the transmitter that act on both
    - Increased flux of potassium ions open up NMDA receptors by removing the magnesium ion block the channel
    - NMDA channel open and allows larger amount of sodium ion and calcium ions in
    - Calcium ions provide signalling cascade which produce more AMPA receptors, **enhancing neural response**
- **Metabotropic: 5-HI serotonin receptor**
  - Receptors that gate ion channels indirectly, like the several types of receptors for **dopamine** and **norepinephrine** in neurons of the cerebral cortex
  - Normally composed of one or at most two subunits that are distinct from the ion channels they regulate
  - **Activation of these receptors often stimulates the production of second messengers** such as cAMP and diacyglycerol
  - Many of the second messengers active **protein kinases**, enzymes that phosphorylate different substrate proteins
  - In many cases the protein kinases directly phosphorylate ion channels, leading to their opening and closing
  - Produce slower synaptic actions lasting seconds to minutes, can modulate behavior by altering the excitability of neurons and the strength of the synaptic connections
  - Often act as crucial reinforcing pathways in the process of learning.
  - **5-HI receptors** are activated by serotonin
    - Serotonin  binds to a 5-HT receptor that is coupled to a **stimulatory G protein** that increases the **activity of adenylyl cyclase**
    - This action produces the **second messenger cAMP** which in turn activates the **cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA)**
    - Serotinin also activates a second type of G protein-coupled receptor that leads to the **hydrolysis of phospholipids and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC)**
    - The protein phosphorylation mediated by PKA and PKC **enhances** the release of transmitter from transmitter from sensory neurons in two mechanisms:
      - **PKA phosphorylates a K$^{+}$ channel**, causing it to close, which broadens the action potential and thus enhances Ca$^{2+}$ influx through voltage-gated Ca$^{2+}$ channels which in turn enhances transmitter release
      - **PKC enhances the functioning of the release machinery directly**

**3. Name three different neurotransmitters and describe one example system for each in which they play
an important role in synaptic transmission or plasticity.**
  a) sensitization b) habituation c) classical conditioning

**5.Describe the sequence of cellular-molecular events during normal synaptic transmission between a
sensory and a motor neuron in the Aplysisa gill withdrawal reflex before and after classical conditioning.**
**BEFORE Classical Conditioning:**
- Touching the siphon excites a population of mechanoreceptor sensory neurons that innervate the siphon
- The release of **glutamate** from sensory neuron terminals generates fast **excitatory postsynaptic potentials** (EPSPs) in the interneurons and motor cells
![11](/assets/11_73svbx843.PNG)
- EPSPs from sensory and interneurons summate on motor cells both temporally and spatially
- The motor cells discharge strongly, thereby producing withdrawal of the gill

**Post Classical Conditioning**
- The motor neuron (postsynaptic neuron) has an increased number of AMPA receptors and activated retrograde signals
- Touching the siphon releases glutamate from sensory neuron terminals
- Because of the enhanced postsynaptic neuron, larger influx of sodium ions flow into the cell
- Retrograde signals such as NO and CO enters the presynaptic synapse causing more vesicles released
- The end result is a higher EPSP generated in the interneurons and motor cells.
- Hence stronger withdrawal reflex is observed
