## L2. DNA RNA Overview
### 2.1 Basic Structure
* Purines: Guanine \& Adenosine are big
* Pyrimidines: Cytosine and Thymine are small
* Weak hydrogen bonds between them, 3 bonds for GC, 2 bonds for AT

</center>

* Major groove (pink) and minor grooves (blue)
  * Major grooves occur where the backbones (red) are far apart
  * Minor grooves occur where they are close together
  * Easier for DNA binding proteins to interact with the bases on the major grooves

![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181015212756](/assets/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181015212756.png)

* Two strands of DNA are pointing opposite each other chemically, 5' (front) end and 3' (reverse) end
* All polymerases operate from 5' to 3' direction
### 2.2 Building blocks of DNA and RNA
* Nucleoside triphosphate is the molecule that is polymerised in order to make DNA and RNA
* DNA: sugar is deoxyribose; bases are ATCG
* RNA: sugar is ribose; bases are ACGU
* RNA is relatively unstable due to uracil, the unmethylated form of thymine (it is the first information storage of life)
* DNA is relatively stable due to thymine
* Nucleoside is **sugar + base**

### 2.3 RNA Structural Diversity
* A single-stranded RNA molecule can base-pair with itself to form structures that are biochemically important
* Examples:
  * Hammerhead ribozyme: RNA cutting RNA enzyme
  * Transfer RNA a small RNA chain of about 80 nucleotides that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation
### 2.4 Amino Acid Structure
* Basic end with amino group (N-terminus)
* Carboxyl group with (C-terminus)
* R-group, around 20 different side groups
<center>

![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016081456](/assets/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016081456.png)
</center>

* Lysine and Arginine are basic to tend to bond well with nucleic acid, used by quiet a lot of binding proteins
<center>

![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016081949](/assets/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016081949.png)
</center>

* Valine, Leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and methionine all have hydrophobic side chains

![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016082240](/assets/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016082240.png)

* **Serine, Threonine, Cystenine** all have hydroxyl groups, so it can bind with a phosphate ion.
  * Used by kinase, which is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups between phosphate-donating molecules to substrates
  * Having a phosphate added or removed switches on or off a protein
  * Serine, threonine kinases
  * Cystenine kinases
* Proline is has side chains that connect back to itself, which typically causes kinks in the chain
* Tryptophan has the largest side group
<center>

### 2.5 Peptide Bond
Peptide bonds are used to link two different amino acids through a dehydration reaction:
<center>

![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016153314](/assets/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016153314.png)
</center>
The peptide bond is planar but bond rotation about the alpha carbon provides great flexibility. Computationally impossible to simulate the folding of proteins using molecular dynamics.

</center>

### 2.6 Protein Structures:
* **Primary structure** refers to the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in an amino acid-chain molecule
* **Secondary structure** within the long protein chains there are regions in which the chains are organised into alpha=helices and beta-pleated sheets, held together by **hydrogen bonds**
  * Alpha helix:
    * The protein chain is coiled like a loosely-coiled spring. "Alpha" meaning looking down the length of the spring, the coiling is happening in a clockwise direction
    * All the R groups are sticking out sideways from the main helix
    * Each complete turn of the spiral has 3.6 amino acid residues in it

  * Beta pleated sheets:
    * Chains are folded so they lie alongside each other
    * A beta strand is a stretch of polypeptide chain typically 3 to 10 amino acids along with backbone in an extended confirmation
  <center>

  ![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016155511](/assets/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016155511.png)
  </center>

  * **Tertiary** structure of proteins describes the way the whole chain (including secondary structure folds itself into its final 3-D shape)
  * **Quaternary structure** is the number and arrangement of multiple folded protein subunits in a multi-subunit complex
    * Haemoglobin tetramer is an example, with 2 a subunits and 2 b subunits. The binding of a oxygen changes the structure of the protein so adding *non linearity* in the molecule, making it more easily carrying a oxygen molecule given one oxygen already attached.

### 2.7 Lipids
* Have charged heads which like to associate with aqueous solutions and fatty tails that like to avoid water
* It may self-assemble into three structures: Liposome, Micelle and Bilayer sheet (often alpha helical)
* Cells are surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane, this membrane barrier isolates the cell contents from the environment, similarly sub-cellular structures can be surrounded by lipid membranes.

## L3. Evolution
### 3.1 Three-domain System
* It is a biological classification (*Carl Woese 1977*) that divides cellular life forms into **archaea, bacteria,** and **eukaryote** domains. In particular, it emphasizes the seperation of prokaryotes into two groups.
* **Domain Archea**
  * Prokaryotic (Unicellular organism that lacks a membrane bound nucleus, mitochondria or any other membrane-bound organelle)
  * Have three RNA polymerases like eukaryotes
  * Have cell walls that lack peptidoglycan and have membranes that enclose lipids with hydroocarbons rather than fatty acids
  * Typically extremophiles which have important roles in carbon and nitrogen cycles
  * Matabolism and robustness useful in Biotechnology

* **Domain Bacteria**
  * Prokaryotic
  * Behave less like eukaryotes with only one RNA polymerase
  * Typically a fre $\mu m$ in size
  * Cell wall made of peptidoglycan
  * React to antibiotics in a different way than archea
  * Most of the known pathogenic prokaryotic organisms belong to bacteria
* **Domain Eukarya**
  * Eukaryotes (organisims that contain a membrane bound nucleus)
  * In exhaustive list incudes: Fungi, plants, animals
* Archea/prokaryotes have typically single circular chromosome with extrachromosomal elements called plasmids
  * Plasmids form the basis for cloning vectors used genetic engineering to insert foreign DNA
  * Plasmids are bad for microbial resistance as they typically carry one or to types of microbial resistance
### 3.2 Mitosis
* Interphase:
  * Where the cell spends the longest time doing
  * Chromatin floats freely
* Prophase:
  * DNA replication occurs (actually during S phase)
  * Chromatin condenses into chromosomes
  * Nucleolus disappears
  * Centromeres move to opposite ends of the cell
* Metaphase:
  * Chromosomes line up along the metaphase plate (imaginary plane)
  * Micro-tubules attach to the chromosomes
* Anaphase:
  * Chromosomes break at centromeres and sister chromatids move to opposite ends of the cell

* Telophase and Cytokinesis:
  * Nuclear membrane reforms
  (Nucleoli reappear, chromosomes unwind into chromatin)
  * Myosin II and actin filament ring contract to cleave cell into two (Cytokinesis)
  * Chromosomes form back into chromatin

### 3.3 Meiosis
* **Diploid cell**: A cell that contains two sets of chromosomes
* **Haploid cell**: A a cell that contains half the usual number of chromosomes
* The goal of meiosis is to produce from a single diploid cell to four haploids.

Like mitosis, it needs to separate sister chromatids (two havles of duplicated chromosome). Also must separate homologous chromosomes, the similar but nonidentical chromosome pairs an organism receives from its parents. These goals are accomplished in meiosis using a two-step division process, homologue pairs separate during a first round of cell division **meiosis I**, sister chromatids separate during **meiosis II**.
* **Meiosis I**
  * **S-Phase** where all of its chromosomes are replicated
  * **Prophase I:**
    * As in mitosis the chromosomes begin to condense
    * In meiosis I, they also pair up, each chromosome carefully aligns with its homologue partner
    * **Crossing over** occurs helped by *synaptonemal complex* which holds the homologues together
    * This causes the formation of new "remixed" chromosomes with unique combinations of alleles

    ![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016190729](/assets/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016190729.png)

  * **Metaphase**:
    * Spindle begins to capture chromosomes and move them towards the metaphase plate
    * Each chromosome attaches to microtubules from just one pole of the spindle
    * So homologue pairs, not individual chromosomes line up for separation
  * **Annaphase I**:
    * Homologues are pulled apart and move apart to opposite ends of the cell
  * **Telophase I** and Cytokinesis similar as Mitosis forming two haploid cells

* **Meiosis II**
  * There is no S-phase in meiosis II
  * Two haploid cells have just one chromosome from each homologue pair
  * **Prophase II**:
    * Chromosomes condense
    * Nuclear envelopes breakdown (if needed)
  * **Metaphase II**:
    * Chromosomes line up individually along the metaphase plate
  * **Anaphase II** sister chromatids separate and are pulled towards opposite poles
  * **Telophase II & Cytokinesis**

## L3. Central Dogma of Molecular Biology
### 3.1 Summary
* What is the material basis for heredity, the faithful storage & transmission of information from one generation to next?
  * DNA encodes the information to produce proteins in terms of the specific sequence of the amino acids
  * Genes can also encode functional RNAs
* What are the molecules/machinery and operating mechanisms that drive the information flow that generates the observed features of an organism?
  * Two step precess with a RNA intermediate
  * Transcription is DNA -> RNA
  * Translation is RNA -> Protein
  * Information flows from DNA to RNA to protein

### 3.2 Hershey & Chase Experiment 1952
* To address the molecule of heredity
* What people knew is viruses inject the molecule which codes for genetic information into the host cell for it to produce more viruses
* Suspects of this molecules is protein or DNA
* First experiment: all proteins in T2 phage are labelled with radio active sulphur
* The host E.coli is infested by T2 phage
* Observed that most radioactivity is recovered outside of E.coli
* Second experiment DNA of the T2 phage are labelled
* Experiment repeated, now most radioactivity discovered in bacteria

### 3.3 Semi-Conservative DNA Replication Model 1953
* There were three models for DNA replication: conservative, semi-conservative and dispersive.
* Meselson and Stahl confirmed that DNA is replicated semi-conservatively through the following experiment:
* Note that the semi-conservative model makes most sense as the two complementary strands of helix might separate during replication, each serving as a template for the construction of a new, matching strand
<center>

![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016222638](/assets/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016222638.png)
</center>

* Experiment begins with growing E.coli in a medium containing only $^{15}\textrm{N}$ until all E.coli's nitrogenous bases were labeled with heavy nitrogen
* Bacteria are then switched to medium containing light $^{14}\textrm{N}$ isotope and allowed to grow for several generations
* Using **density gradient centrifugation** method, after each generation the content of the bacteria samples are measured
* Generation 1:
  * Also produced a single band when centrifuged
  * However this band was higher, intermediate in density between the heavy $^{15}\textrm{N}$  and the light $^{14}\textrm{N}$
  * This means the DNA molecules made in the first round of replication was a hybrid of light and heavy DNA
  * This canfirms that the replication process is either semi-conservative or dispersive
* Generation 2:
  * Produced two bands, one was in the same position as the intermediate band from the first generation
  * Second was higher (appeared to be labelled only with $^{14}\textrm{N}$ )
  * This confirms the semi conservative model since if dispersive, there would never any pure $^{14}\textrm{N}$  band forming
  <center>

  ![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016230835](/assets/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181016230835.png)
  </center>

  * The relative proportions of the $^{14}\textrm{N}$ /$^{15}\textrm{N}$ DNAs is defined as a geometric progression over the $i$th generation:
  $$
  D_{14/15}(i)= \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{i-1} \quad \forall i \geq 1
  $$
  And $^{14}\textrm{N}$/$^{14}\textrm{N}$ proportion simply defined as:
  $$
  D_{14/14}(i)= 1- D_{14/15}  = 1- \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{i-1} \quad \forall i \geq 1
  $$

### 3.4 Nucleoside VS Nucleotide
 * Nucleo**t**ide contains three things: sugar + base + phosphate
 * Nucleoside contains two things: sugar and base
 * When the 2' carbon is connected to only an H group, the sugar is called deoxiribose. If connected to an HO group, then it is called oxiribose
 * When the 4' carbon is connected to a triphosphate group, it is called nucleoside-triphosphate
 * Monomer subunits of DNA:
    * Deoxyribonucleoside-triphosphate (dNTP)
    * Consists of two purines dATP (deoxy adenosine tri-phosphate) and dGTP (deoxy guanosine tri-phosphate)
    * Two pyrimadines dTTP (deoxy thymidine tri-phosphate) and dCTP (deoxy cytidine tri-phosphate)
 * dATP forms two hydrogen bonds with dTTP
 * dGTP forms three with dCTP
 * **Polymerization of Nucleotides**:
    * The 5' group of a nucleotide triphosphate is held close to the free 3' hydroxyl group of a nucleotide chain
    * The 3' hydroxyl group forms a bond to the phosphorus atom of the free nucleotide. Meanwhile, the bond between the first phosphorus atom and oxygen atom linking it to the next phosphate group breaks
    * A new phosphodiester bond now joins the two nucleotides. A pyrophosphate group has been liberated
    * Pyrophosphate group is hydrolysed, releasing energy and driving the reaction forward to completion
    <center>

    </center>

### 3.5 DNA Polymerases
  * **They only add on the 3' end**, going from 5' to 3' direction
  * Only when the correct base pair from the nucleoside triphosphate arrives would DNA polymerase catalyse the polymerization
  * The polymerase itself has certain proofreading abilities
  <center>

  ![DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181017001037](/assets/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20181017001037.png)
  </center>

### 3.6 DNA Replication

* First, **topoisomerase** unwinds the double strand by releasing the strain energy through temporarily breaking up the phosphate backbone
* **Helicase** is used to break up the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases
* For the 5' to 3' strand (leading strand):
  * RNA primer is added onto the beginning of the exposed nitrogenous bases by DNA primase
  * DNA polymerase starts to add nucleotides on the 3' end
* For the 3' to 5' strand (lagging strand):
  * RNA primer is added once several tens of exposed bases by the DNA primase
  * DNA polymerase can then add nucleosides onto the 3' end
  * These chunks are called Okazaki fragments
* Once all strands and fragments have been polymerised, the enzyme **exonuclease** removes all RNA primers
* Another DNA polymerase then fills in the gaps, leaving unconnected sugar phosphate backbones (nick site)
* Finally, enzyme ligase joins the sugar-phosphate backbones at each nick site completing replication

</center>

### 3.7 Transcription: Making of mRNA
* **Gene:**
  * A continuous strand of nucleotides containing a region that codes for an RNA molecule
  * Begins with a promoter (region) and ends with a terminator (region)
  * Also contain regulatory sequences that can be found near the promoter or at a more distant location
* RNA polymerase binds to the promoter DNA
* RNA polymerase creates a **transcription bubble**  which seperates the two strands of the DNA helix, done by breaking the hydrogen bonds between complementary DNA nucleotides
* During **elongation**, the RNA polymerase slides along the DNA strand
* RNA polymerase adds RNA molecules which are complementary to the nucleotides of the 5' to 3' strand
* RNA sugar-phosphate backbone forms with assistance from RNA polymerase to form an RNA strand
* Hydrogen bonds of the RNA-DNA helix break, freeing the newly synthesised RNA strand
* RNA is further processed through **polyaldenylation** (addition of poly(A) tail), **capping** and **splicing** (introns removed, exons joined)
<center>

### 3.8 Translation: Making of Proteins

#### 3.8.1 Condons and Codon Degeneracy
* A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides which together form a unit of genetic code in a DNA or RNA molecule
* Using 4 bases there are in total $4^3=64$ different combinations of amino acids, in reality however, there are only around 20
* This is due to the degeneracy of codons which is the redundancy of genetic code which prevents point mutation
#### 3.8.2 Process of Translation
* **Initiation:**
  * A ribosome, an mRNA and an initiator tRNA carrying the first amino acid (always methionine) in the protein arrives on the translation site forming an **initiation complex**
  * In Eucaryotes, small ribosomal subunit binds with the mRNA 5' cap upstream of the 5' start codon
  * The small complex then scans to find the start codon, once found the initiator tRNA forms complementary base pairs between its anti codons and the start codons on the mRNA
  * Large ribosomal subunit binds with the initiator tRNA which completes the initiation process forming initiation complex
* **Elongation**
  * There are three sites in the initiation complex, namely P,A,E site
  * The first initiator tRNA occupies the P site, the next tRNA enters the A site which is complementary to the next codon on the mRNA
  * The methionine forms peptide bonds with the next amino acid and the uncharged tRNA moves onto the E site which exits the complex
  * The complex jerks forward and repeats the process until termination
* **Termination**
  * Termination happens when a stop codon in the mRNA (UAA,UAG or UGA) enters the A site
  * Stop codons are recognised by proteins called release factors which fit into the P site
  * Release factors make the enzyme that normally for peptide bonds to add a water molecule to the last amino acid of the chain
  * This reaction separates the chain from the tRNA, a newly made protein is released

## L4. Control of Gene Expression
* **Gene expression**: the process of production of the protein encoded by an individual gene
* **Gene expression**: mechanisms to control whether or not the protein encoded by an individual gene is expressed

**Case study: The Lac Operon**
* Definitions:
  * An **operon** is a functioning unit of DNA containing a cluster of genes under the control of a single promoter
  * The **promoter** is the sequence where the RNA polymerase binds and begins transcription
  * An **operator** is a regulatory sequence that a **repressor** can bind to, when it does the transcription process is halter by physically blocking the binding of the RNA polymerase to the promoter region

<center>

</center>

In the figure above, we see a sequence of DNA containing the lac operon under the promoter $P_{lac}$ and the gene for repressor $lacI$ (genes are denoted in lowercase). Several cases of the expressions of the lac operon under different environments is described below:
**No lactose:**
* $lacI$ is transcribed into $LacI$ repressor proteins forming a tetramer which binds the operators of the lac operon
* This inhibits the binding between the lac operon promoter and RNA polymerase which halts transcription

<center>

![Screenshot 2018-10-25 at 21.58.49](/assets/Screenshot%202018-10-25%20at%2021.58.49.png)
</center>

**Moderate to high level lactose with no glucose: Positive feedback**
* Lactose enters cell membrane and is broken down by beta-galactosidase into allolactose which is a operon inducer together with glucose and galactose
* Allolactose binds with the $LacI$ repressors causing it to fall off the operators
* This enables RNA polymerase to bind onto the promoter and initiate the transcription of $lacZ$, $lacY$ and $lacA$ mRNAs
* $lacZ$ codes for beta-galactosidase which in turn breaks down lactose to produce allolactose
* $lacY$ codes for permease which binds with the cell membrane to increase the permeability of the cell to glactosides (including lactose, allolactose) via active transport thereby causing a "positive feedback"
* $lacZ$ codes for transacetylase which transfers an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to glactosides

<center>

</center>
**Accelerating transcription with cAMP**
* cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) has a inverse correlation with cell glucose level
* Without the presence of CAP (catabolite activator protein), RNA polymerase alone does not bind well to the lac operon promoter
* cAMP attaches to CAP allowing it to bind onto the CAP site (highlighted in blue before the promoter for the lac operon

## L5. Molecular Cloning
### 5.1 Gene Cloning
* Plasmids are removed from bacterial cells (E. coli) which serve as vectors typically include:
  * Antibiotic resistance genes i.e. ampicillin resistance ($amp^r$), acting as a marker for later selection stage
  * LacZ gene which is responsible for the blue colour, also acting as a marker
  * **Multiple cloning sites** MCS which is the placeholder for the later inserted genes
* DNA containing the gene is also taken from the cell
* A **restriction enzyme** (restriction endonuclease) recognises its specific restriction site and cuts the DNA leaving overhangs called **sticky ends**
* The restriction enzymes also cut open the circular plasmids (using the same enzyme cuts out the gene of interest from its DNA molecule)
* The sticky ends of the restriction fragments attach to each other via base pairing, forming **recombinant plasmids**
* **DNA ligase** makes the bond permanent by attaching nucleotides to each other with **phosphodiester bonds**
* The plasmids are mixed with the bacteria through two main methods (all work like magic):
  * Chemical transformaion
    * wash cells in chilled $CaCl_2$ to permeabilise the membrane
    * 42 degrees heat shock to promote DNA uptake
  * Transformation by electroporation
    * wash cells in water to remove ions
    * 5-20kV/cm shock promotes DNA uptake
  * Both methods are followed by a *recovery period* in rich medium to allow time for expression of the antibiotic resistance gene
* Plasmids with an uninterrupted LacZ gene turn their bacteria blue (unsuccessful ligation)
* Both the recombinant plasmids where the inserted gene interrupts the Lac Z gene and the bacteria which did not take up any plasmids remain uncoloured
* Antibiotics are added, because the plasmid contains the genes for antibiotic resistance, only bacteria which took up the plasmid survive
* The uncoloured bacteria can then be allowed to reproduce

**Limitations:**
* Require very highly purified enzymes which is expensive
* Require restriction sites in the right places which is left to chance

### 5.2 PCR
* Polymerase chain reaction requires:
  * Taq DNA polymerase which is stable under high temperature (95 degrees)
  * DNA primers designed specifically for the DNA region of interest
    * Around 20 nucleotides in length
    * Two primers are used in each PCR reaction designed so they flank the target region
  * PCR buffers to provide the optimal condition for Taq polymerase
  * Nanograms of the DNA strand
* **Denaturation** (96 degrees):
  * Heat the reaction strongly to denature the DNA strands by separating the hydrogen bonds
  * Provides single stranded template for the next step
* **Annealing** (55-65 degrees):
  * Cool the reaction so the primers can bind to their complementary sequences on the single-strand template DNA
* **Extension** (72 degrees):
  * Raise the reaction temperatures so Taq polymerase extends the primers, synthesising new strands of DNA
* Cycle is repeated 25-35 times in a typical PCR reaction which takes 2-4 hours depending on the length of the DNA region

Sketching the process out we see that within each procedure, the expected number of DNA after $T$ cycles assuming perfect annealing and extension processes is, starting from $M$ number of DNA molecules:
$$
M \left(\sum_{n=1}^T 2^n-2 \right)
$$

</center>

Things that can go wrong and their solutions:
* No product: check primer design, decrease annealing
 temperature, vary MgCl2 levels
* Multiple products: check primer design, use hot start enzyme,
 increase annealing temperature, vary MgCl2 levels
* Product in negative control: contamination (use laminar air flow
 hood, filter tips)
* Primer dimers: primers self-prime or prime on each other. Redesign primers

### 5.4 Gibson Assembly:
* A DNA ligation technique that can join two blunt ended pieces of DNA
* Uses three enzumes:
  * T5 exonuclease Degrades DNA in 5' to 3' direction at 50 degrees, thereby generating 3' overhangs
  * Taq ligase: Catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds between juxtaposed two adjacent nucleotides
  * Phusion polymerase: facilitates the annealing of the exposed fragments
* Procedures:
  * During PCR, primers are designed to add sticky ends (flaps) at the end of genes
  ![Screenshot 2018-11-20 at 13.23.41](/assets/Screenshot%202018-11-20%20at%2013.23.41.png)
  * 5' to 3' exonuclease chews away the DNA strands in that direction exposing 3' overhangs

**Limitations:**
* Very few, may be expensive for 100,000 bases synthesis
**Advantage:**
* Seamless joining of arbitrary DNA fragments
* Multiple fragments can be joined in one step
* Cheaper than *de novo* synthesis

### 5.5 Large Scale De Novo synthesis
* De novo synthesis refers to the synthesis of complex molecules from simple molecules such as sugars or amino acids
* **Advantages:**
  * Independent of restriction enzymes
  * Independent on ability to PCR fragments of interest
  * Allows complete redesign of DNA sequence
* **Limitations:**
  * High cost
  * Scale: typical ~1kb cloning is now cost-effective for well-funded lab
