## L2. DNA RNA Overview
### 2.1 Basic Structure
* Purines: Guanine \& Adenosine are big
* Pyrimidines: Cytosine and Thymine are small
* Weak hydrogen bonds between them, 3 bonds for GC, 2 bonds for AT

* Major groove (pink) and minor grooves (blue)
  * Major grooves occur where the backbones (red) are far apart
  * Minor grooves occur where they are close together
  * Easier for DNA binding proteins to interact with the bases on the major grooves

* Two strands of DNA are pointing opposite each other chemically, 5' (front) end and 3' (reverse) end
* All polymerases operate from 5' to 3' direction
### 2.2 Building blocks of DNA and RNA
* Nucleoside triphosphate is the molecule that is polymerised in order to make DNA and RNA
* DNA: sugar is deoxyribose; bases are ATCG
* RNA: sugar is ribose; bases are ACGU
* RNA is relatively unstable due to uracil, the unmethylated form of thymine (it is the first information storage of life)
* DNA is relatively stable due to thymine
* Nucleoside is **sugar + base**

### 2.3 RNA Structural Diversity
* A single-stranded RNA molecule can base-pair with itself to form structures that are biochemically important
* Examples:
  * Hammerhead ribozyme: RNA cutting RNA enzyme
  * Transfer RNA a small RNA chain of about 80 nucleotides that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation
### 2.4 Amino Acid Structure
* Basic end with amino group (N-terminus)
* Carboxyl group with (C-terminus)
* R-group, around 20 different side groups

* Lysine and Arginine are basic to tend to bond well with nucleic acid, used by quiet a lot of binding proteins

* Valine, Leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and methionine all have hydrophobic side chains

* **Serine, Threonine, Cystenine** all have hydroxyl groups, so it can bind with a phosphate ion.
  * Used by kinase, which is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups between phosphate-donating molecules to substrates
  * Having a phosphate added or removed switches on or off a protein
  * Serine, threonine kinases
  * Cystenine kinases
* Proline is has side chains that connect back to itself, which typically causes kinks in the chain
* Tryptophan has the largest side group

* Cysteine contains sulphur can form cross links between different parts of the protein

### 2.5 Peptide Bond
Peptide bonds are used to link two different amino acids through a dehydration reaction:

</center>
The peptide bond is planar but bond rotation about the alpha carbon provides great flexibility. Computationally impossible to simulate the folding of proteins using molecular dynamics.

### 2.6 Protein Structures:
* **Primary structure** refers to the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in an amino acid-chain molecule
* **Secondary structure** within the long protein chains there are regions in which the chains are organised into alpha=helices and beta-pleated sheets, held together by **hydrogen bonds**
  * Alpha helix:
    * The protein chain is coiled like a loosely-coiled spring. "Alpha" meaning looking down the length of the spring, the coiling is happening in a clockwise direction
    * All the R groups are sticking out sideways from the main helix
    * Each complete turn of the spiral has 3.6 amino acid residues in it

  * Beta pleated sheets:
    * Chains are folded so they lie alongside each other
    * A beta strand is a stretch of polypeptide chain typically 3 to 10 amino acids along with backbone in an extended confirmation

  * **Tertiary** structure of proteins describes the way the whole chain (including secondary structure folds itself into its final 3-D shape)
  * **Quaternary structure** is the number and arrangement of multiple folded protein subunits in a multi-subunit complex
    * Haemoglobin tetramer is an example, with 2 a subunits and 2 b subunits. The binding of a oxygen changes the structure of the protein so adding *non linearity* in the molecule, making it more easily carrying a oxygen molecule given one oxygen already attached.

### 2.7 Lipids
* Have charged heads which like to associate with aqueous solutions and fatty tails that like to avoid water
* It may self-assemble into three structures: Liposome, Micelle and Bilayer sheet.
* Cells are surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane, this membrane barrier isolates the cell contents from the environment, similarly sub-cellular structures can be surrounded by lipid membranes.

## L3. Evolution
### 3.1 Three-domain System
* It is a biological classification (*Carl Woese 1977*) that divides cellular life forms into **archaea, bacteria,** and **eukaryote** domains. In particular, it emphasizes the seperation of prokaryotes into two groups.
* **Domain Archea**
  * Prokaryotic (Unicellular organism that lacks a membrane bound nucleus, mitochondria or any other membrane-bound organelle)
  * Have three RNA polymerases like eukaryotes
  * Have cell walls that lack peptidoglycan and have membranes that enclose lipids with hydroocarbons rather than fatty acids
  * Typically extremophiles which have important roles in carbon and nitrogen cycles
  * Matabolism and robustness useful in Biotechnology

* **Domain Bacteria**
  * Prokaryotic
  * Behave less like eukaryotes with only one RNA polymerase
  * Typically a fre $\mu m$ in size
  * Cell wall made of peptidoglycan
  * React to antibiotics in a different way than archea
  * Most of the known pathogenic prokaryotic organisms belong to bacteria
* **Domain Eukarya**
  * Eukaryotes (organisims that contain a membrane bound nucleus)
  * In exhaustive list incudes: Fungi, plants, animals
* Archea/prokaryotes have typically single circular chromosome with extrachromosomal elements called plasmids
  * Plasmids form the basis for cloning vectors used genetic engineering to insert foreign DNA
  * Plasmids are bad for microbial resistance as they typically carry one or to types of microbial resistance
### 3.2 Mitosis
* Interphase:
  * Where the cell spends the longest time doing
  * Chromatin floats freely
* Prophase:
  * DNA replication occurs
  * Chromatin condenses into chromosomes
  * Nucleolus disappears
  * Centromeres move to opposite ends of the cell
* Metaphase:
  * Chromosomes line up along the metaphase plate (imaginary plane)
  * Micro-tubules attach to the chromosomes
* Anaphase:
  * Chromosomes break at centromeres and sister chromatids move to opposite ends of the cell

* Telophase and Cytokinesis:
  * Nuclear membrane reforms
  (Nucleoli reappear, chromosomes unwind into chromatin)
  * Myosin II and actin filament ring contract to cleave cell into two (Cytokinesis)
  * Chromosomes form back into chromatin

### 3.3 Meiosis
* **Diploid cell**: A cell that contains two sets of chromosomes
* **Haploid cell**: A a cell that contains half th usual number of chromosomes
